    <h1>Children</h1>
    <h3>By Gibran Khalil Gibran</h3>
    <h5>Poetic Essay from The Prophet Book</h5>
</div>


<div id="poam">
    <p id="line1">A woman who held a baby against her bosom said, 'Speak to us of Children. </p>
    <p id="line2">And he said:</p>
    <p id="line3">Your children are not your children.</p>
    <p id="line4">They are the sons and daughters of Life's longing for itself.</p>
    <p id="line5">They come through you but not from you,</p>
    <p id="line6">And though they are with you, yet they belong not to you.</p>
    <p id="line7">You may give them your love but not your thoughts.</p>
    <p id="line8">For they have their own thoughts.</p>
    <p id="line9">You may house their bodies but not their souls,</p>
    <p id="line10">For their souls dwell in the house of tomorrow, which you cannot visit, not even in your dreams.</p>
    <p id="line11">You may strive to be like them but seek not to make them like you.</p>
    <p id="line12">The archer sees the mark upon the path of the infinite, and He bends you with His might that His arrows may go swift and far.</p>
    <p id="line13">Let your bending in the archer's hand be for gladness;</p>
    <p id="line14">For even as he loves the arrow that flies, so He loves also the bow that is stable.</p>
    <p id="line15">For life goes not backward nor tarries with yesterday.</p>
    <p id="line16">You are the bows from which your children as living arrows are sent forth.</p>
